# Striving for Simplicity in Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project provides the open source implementation using the
[Dopamine][dopamine] framework for running experiments mentioned in [Striving for Simplicity in Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning][paper].
In this work, we use the logged experiences of a DQN agent for training off-policy
agents (shown below) in an offline setting (*i.e.*, [batch RL][batch_rl]) without any new
interaction with the environment during training.

## Atari-Replay Dataset (Logged DQN data)

The atari-replay-dataset dataset was collected as follows:
We first train a [DQN][nature_dqn] agent, on all 60 [Atari 2600 games][ale]
with [sticky actions][stochastic_ale] enabled for 200 million frames (standard protocol) and save all of the experience tuples
of *(observation, action, reward, next observation)* (approximately 50 million)
encountered during training.

This logged DQN data can be found in the public [GCP bucket][gcp_bucket]
`gs://atari-replay-datasets` which can be downloaded using [`gsutil`][gsutil].
To install gsutil, follow the instructions [here][gsutil_install].

After installing gsutil, run the command to copy the entire dataset:

```
gsutil -m cp -R gs://atari-replay-datasets/dqn
```

To run the dataset only for a specific Atari 2600 game (*e.g.*, replace `GAME_NAME`
by `Pong` to download the logged DQN replay datasets for the game of Pong),
run the command:

```
gsutil -m cp -R gs://atari-replay-datasets/dqn/[GAME_NAME]
```


This data can be generated by running the online agents using
[`batch_rl/baselines/train.py`](https://github.com/anonymous-code-github/offline-rl/blob/master/batch_rl/baselines/train.py) for 200 million frames
(standard protocol). Note that the dataset consists of approximately 50 million
experience tuples due to frame skipping (*i.e.*, repeating a selected action for
`k` consecutive frames) of 4. The stickiness parameter is set to 0.25, *i.e.*,
there is 25% chance at every time step that the environment will execute the
agent's previous action again, instead of the agent's new action.

## Installation
Install the dependencies below, based on your operating system, and then
install Dopamine, *e.g*.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/google/dopamine.git
```

Finally, download the source code for batch RL, *e.g.*

```
git clone https://github.com/anonymous-code-github/offline-rl.git
```

### Ubuntu

If you don't have access to a GPU, then replace `tensorflow-gpu` with
`tensorflow` in the line below (see [Tensorflow
instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux) for details).

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev
pip install absl-py atari-py gin-config gym opencv-python tensorflow-gpu
```

### Mac OS X

```
brew install cmake zlib
pip install absl-py atari-py gin-config gym opencv-python tensorflow
```

## Running Tests

Assuming that you have cloned the
[offline-rl](https://github.com/anonymous-code-github/offline-rl.git) repository,
follow the instructions below to run unit tests.

#### Basic test
You can test whether basic code is working by running the following:

```
cd batch_rl
python -um batch_rl.tests.atari_init_test
```

#### Test for training an agent with fixed replay buffer
To test an agent using a fixed replay buffer, first generate the data for the
Atari 2600 game of `Pong` to `$DATA_DIR`.

```
export DATA_DIR="Insert directory name here"
mkdir -p $DATA_DIR/Pong
gsutil -m cp -R gs://batch-rl-datasets/dqn/Pong/1 $DATA_DIR/Pong
```

Assuming the replay data is present in `$DATA_DIR/Pong/1/replay_logs`, run the `FixedReplayDQNAgent` on `Pong` using the logged DQN data:

```
cd batch_rl
python -um batch_rl.tests.fixed_replay_runner_test \
  --replay_dir=$DATA_DIR/Pong/1
```

## Training batch agents on DQN data

The entry point to the standard Atari 2600 experiment is
[`batch_rl/fixed_replay/train.py`](https://github.com/anonymous-code-github/offline-rl/blob/master/batch_rl/fixed_replay/train.py).
Run the batch `DQN` agent using the following command:

```
python -um batch_rl.fixed_replay.train \
  --base_dir=/tmp/batch_rl \
  --replay_dir=$DATA_DIR/Pong/1 \
  --gin_files='batch_rl/fixed_replay/configs/dqn.gin'
```

By default, this will kick off an experiment lasting 200 training iterations
(equivalent to experiencing 200 million frames for an online agent).

To get finer-grained information about the process,
you can adjust the experiment parameters in
[`batch_rl/fixed_replay/configs/dqn.gin`](https://github.com/anonymous-code-github/offline-rl/blob/master/batch_rl/fixed_replay/configs/dqn.gin),
in particular by increasing the `FixedReplayRunner.num_iterations` to see
the asymptotic performance of the batch agents. For example,
run the batch `REM` agent for 800 training iterations on the game of Pong
using the following command:

```
python -um batch_rl.fixed_replay.train \
  --base_dir=/tmp/batch_rl \
  --replay_dir=$DATA_DIR/Pong/1 \
  --agent_name=multi_head_dqn \
  --gin_files='batch_rl/fixed_replay/configs/rem.gin' \
  --gin_bindings='FixedReplayRunner.num_iterations=1000' \
  --gin_bindings='atari_lib.create_atari_environment.game_name = "Pong"'
```

More generally, since this code is based on Dopamine, it can be
easily configured using the
[gin configuration framework](https://github.com/google/gin-config).
